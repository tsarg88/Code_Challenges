Hello, I would like to complain about our plan's data: we pay $145 and only get 15GB for 4 lines, in the mean time, i.e., Verizon offers UNLIMITED data for $35 per line(for 4 lines) and T-Mobile offers UNLIMITED data for only $25 per line(for 4 lines). That is not fair at all from AT&T side!!!
Can you at least add some more Gigabytes to our plan?
