// Write a function that receives two portions of a path and joins them. The portions will be joined with the "/" separator.
// There could be only one separator and if it is not present it should be added.

// Examples:
// joinPath("portion1", "portion2") ➞ "portion1/portion2"
// joinPath("portion1/", "portion2") ➞ "portion1/portion2"
// joinPath("portion1", "/portion2") ➞ "portion1/portion2"
// joinPath("portion1/", "/portion2") ➞ "portion1/portion2"

// Notes:
// Try not to solve this challenge using only if-else conditions.

function joinPath(portion1, portion2) {
  if (!portion1.includes("/") && !portion2.includes("/")) {
    return portion1 + "/" + portion2;
  } else if (portion1.includes("/") || portion2.includes("/")) {
    return portion1.replace("/", "") + "/" + portion2.replace("/", "");
  }
}
console.log(joinPath("portion1", "portion2"));
